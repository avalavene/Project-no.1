# Project-no.1
This includes files for project No.1 [This project focuses on examining air quality measurements gathered from multiple sites throughout Nebraska through the dates of February 2024 to March 2025 to support UNMCs efforts to better understand the links between air pollution and human health. The primary objectives of this analysis include determining five hotspot locations in the state that have the highest average median concentrations of VOC, PM2.5, and PM10.0. as well as, identifying the dates these values occur, and determining the possible contributing factors. In addition to this, there must be an evaluation of the influence of temperature and humidity on air quality conditions. Locations and time periods where levels of PM2.5 and PM10.0 reached air quality index levels associated with health concerns and their possible causes. Finally, assessing whether sensor elevation plays a role in air quality measurements.]
